                        <p>For personal health questions, it is always best to speak to your healthcare provider. All of our teas include a detailed ingredients list written on the side of each box, and on each tea’s individual online product’s page. This will provide you with the necessary information needed to ask your doctor on whether specific blends or ingredients are right for you.</p>

                      <div class="answer">
                        <p>Most of our teas contain virtually no sugar, carbohydrates or calories. However, do understand that it is extremely difficult to pinpoint the nutritional facts on tea since it is a natural product, like a fruit or vegetable. Calories and carbohydrates cannot be calculated due to the minuscule amount found in tea leaves. Without milk or sugar added to tea, tea contains very little calories.</p>

                      <div class="answer">
                        <p>It’s hard to say for sure due to a ton of factors, such as water temperature and steeping time, that can change the amount of caffeine in a cup. Although it’s virtually impossible to measure the exact amount of caffeine in every cup, all our teas have been tested and rated with a general rating system as below:</p>
                        <p>♣ Caffeine-free <br>♣ Medium caffeine <br>♣ High caffeine</p>

                      </div>
                      <div class="answer">
                        <p>All our teas are inspired by various Asian heritages and cultures</p>

                      </div>
                      <div class="answer">
                        <p>In many cases, the flavour profile will be unique with each steeping. Re-steeping is not necessarily recommended for tisanes. For best results, you should also only re-steep within the first couple of hours of the first infusion.</p>
                      </div>

                        <p>Why do your teas contain flavouring? </p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="answer">
                        <p>Rest assured that only natural flavourings are used in our blends. These flavourings are added to give each of our teas its unique taste profile. However, if you’re not keen on flavourings, we have plenty of other unflavoured blends available.</p>

                      </div>
                      <div class="answer">
                        <p>Although tea does not go bad, it does become stale over time. We generally recommend drinking any of our teas within 2 years of purchase or before best date indicated.</p>

                      <div class="answer">
                        <p>We recommend that you store your loose tea in an air-tight container, kept away from direct sunlight and in a cool and dry environment.</p>

                        <p>Yes you can. When you purchase as a guest, your details won’t be recorded but will only be used for the purpose of the sales transaction. All you need is a valid e-mail to receive order details. But we highly recommend that you sign up for an account for a faster check out the next time, and to receive personalised recommendations and stay updated with our deals and offers.</p>

                        <p>You’re rewarded with 10 points when you sign up for an account with us. Each point is worth $0.10, so it’s $1 earned for account registration. It’s like a 10% cashback. These points can be used to offset your next purchase. There is no minimum purchase or maximum limit on the amount of points you can redeem.</p>

                        <p>Here are some possible solutions to try out:</p>
                        <p>1) Make sure you’re typing in the right email address and password. You might not have registered with your primary address. <br>2) Try not to copy and paste the email and password – this sometimes adds an extra “space” into your password that you aren’t able to see. <br>3) If you can’t remember your password or it’s just not working, use the ‘Forgot Password’ link on the login page to have it reset and sent to you. <br>4) If you still can't log in, please contact us via our ‘Contact Us’ page and we'll take a look!</p>
